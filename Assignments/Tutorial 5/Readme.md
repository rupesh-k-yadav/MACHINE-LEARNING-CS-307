Task 5 : 

Please code the Kernel Regression in Python and share this to me as Colab notebook.
Dataset: Take 10 points (x_i) from the uniform distribution from 0 to 1.
then y_i = Sin(2*pi*x_i) + random noise.
Random noise can be draw from normal standard distribution.

PS: You need to approximately reproduce the same figure 6.3 from PRML.
Best Wishes.
